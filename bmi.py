# Jeshua N. Arias Santos || Python Exercise
# Instructions, create a BMI (Body Mass Index) that calculates my own BMI to calculate my body fat 

# First I will declare the values starting by my own mass, I weight around 156 pounds, meaning that is equal to 70 KG, and a height of 180 cm approximately

mass = 70 
height = 180 

# The formula I will use will be the following: bmi = mass/height**2

height = 180 ** 2

# Below we have the full execution of the formula and printing the output to the terminal. 

bmi = mass/height
print(bmi)
